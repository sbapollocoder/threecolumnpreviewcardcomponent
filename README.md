## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- Continued use of flexbox
- Used box-sizing: border-box; to help keep to precise sizes
- Used a media query

### Continued development

- Clean up the CSS with Sass, specifically the colours, better hierarchy and possibly splitting out sections, and find out how to automate the Sass process when deploying
- Possibly find better ways to target the CSS elements
- The challenge only specified certain screen sizes which has been kept to but it could be extended to be responsive at more sizes

### Useful resources

- (https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - Explains flexbox with some great examples that are laid out well and understandable.
